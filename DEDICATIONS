Thanks to:

Russ Smith (Random), for writing the first tinyclient.

Anton Rang (Tarrant), for writing the client this whole thing was based
on, and for finding some minor bugs in earlier versions.

Greg Hudson (Explorer_Bob), for writing TF versions up to 1.5.3, without
which I would have never gotten into this mess.

Leo Plotkin (Grod), for helping Greg and for writing a beautiful (for
Grodcode), albeit case-sensitive, match routine.

David Moore (OliverJones), Ben Jackson (Ben), the users of
glia.biostr.washington.edu, and everyone else who tested, found bugs,
or came up with suggestions.

All my fans, even if they come up with the most outrageously false
statements (e.g. "Tinyfugue is a work of art.").

All my detractors, for coming up with good one-liners.
