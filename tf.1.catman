          _T_i_n_y_F_u_g_u_e (also known as "Fugue" or "TF") is a line-based
          client for connecting to MUD servers (especially TinyMUD-
          style MUDs).

          Most of the _T_F documentation is in the help file, which may
          be read with the "/help" command.  The tf macro library
          should define the name of the help file in the HHHHEEEELLLLPPPPFFFFIIIILLLLEEEE
          macro.  This manual page may, unfortunately, be obsolete in
          certain ways; however, the helpfile will usually be up-to-
          date.

          _T_i_n_y_F_u_g_u_e is larger than most MUD clients, and has many more
          features.  The goal is to provide the most functionality in
          a client that still maintains the user-friendliness of
          _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k.  Clients with extension languages such as _T_c_l_t_t or
          _V_a_p_o_r_T_a_l_k can do more in certain areas, but are considerably
          harder to learn.  _T_F provides most of these abilities in
          such a manner that learning to use any one function is
          relatively easy.  See the NOTES section for a list of
          backward incompatablities.

          Because I am continually adding new features and changing
          the code, _T_F sometimes becomes less stable in a new release.
          For this reason, all _T_F versions so far have been labeled
          "beta" or even "alpha", and I leave some older versions at
          the FTP site where I distribute _T_F (ferkel.ucsb.edu), which
          do not have all the current features but may have fewer bugs
          than the most recent release.

          will try to connect to the first world defined in the
          configuration file(s).

          _T_F with hhhhoooosssstttt and ppppoooorrrrtttt arguments will define a temporary

          number or regular name format.

          If no world is specified, or _T_F can not connect to the
          specified world, _T_F will start up in unconnected mode.

          _T_F will attempt to read two files when starting.  The first
          is a public configuration file, defined by the person who
          installed the copy of _T_F you are using (named "tf.library",
          probably in /usr/local/lib or under the home directory of
          the installer).  The macro library should define the
          HHHHEEEELLLLPPPPFFFFIIIILLLLEEEE macro, and probably also defines some other useful
          macros for compatibilty with older versions of _T_F.

          Next, _T_F will attempt to read your personal configuration
          file, "$HOME/.tfrc", in which you can put any _T_F commands
          you want executed automatically at startup.  One of the most
          common commands used in a _T_F configuration file is /load, so
          you can keep groups of commands in separate files.  Because
          you can modify your worlds, macros, triggers, hooks,
          hilites, gags, and key bindings from within _T_F, and then
          save them back to the file with the /save command, you can
          modify these things without directly editing the files, if
          the /load command is used.

          For backward compatability, if ~/.tfrc can not be found, _T_F
          will try to read the _T_i_n_y_T_a_l_k configuration file.  Its name
          defautls to $HOME/.tinytalk, or can be defined by the
          TINYTALK environment variable.  This file may start with a
          list of worlds that will be defined as if with /addworld.
          This is not recommended; it may not be supported in future
          releases.

          Anton Rang (Tarrant) in February of 1990 released _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k,
          the first Tinyclient with any great number of features,
          including hiliting and suppression of text, simple triggers,
          and separating input and output on the screen.  Leo Plotkin
          (Grod) made rather extensive modifications to _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k to
          produce _T_i_n_y_w_a_r, which was plagued with some serious bugs

          and was never officially released (the phrase "Tinywar
          doesn't exist" is often quoted), and is now an unsupported
          client.  _T_F began when Greg Hudson (Explorer_Bob) merged
          many of the new features of _T_i_n_y_w_a_r back into _T_i_n_y_T_a_l_k, and
          added many new features of his own, most notably the
          windowing system.  Some of the code in Greg's releases was
          contributed by Leo Plotkin.  After Greg moved on to
          _V_a_p_o_r_T_a_l_k, Ken Keys (Hawkeye) took over design and
          maintenance of _T_F in July 1991, and continues to make
          improvements in features and performance.

          The code size of _T_F has surpassed 350K (unstripped), and is
          2-3 times the size of _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k.  It is, in fact, more than
          three times the size of a number of existing servers.  As of
          v2.1 beta, it has 76 builtin commands, each documented in
          the helpfile, and 69 standard library macros.

          It has been stated that _T_F is the most-used client in MUDdom
          at the current time.  I haven't taken a poll, but I wouldn't
          be surprised.

          _T_F has significantly changed the tinyclient world.  It has a
          number of merits and a number of flaws, and has frequently
          been criticized (mostly out of boredom; nobody takes this
          business too seriously) as having too many features and
          being too damn big.

               "Tinywar doesn't exist; TinyFugue merely shouldn't."
          -- Coined by Woodlock, I believe.

               "TinyFugue is a work of art."  -- Binder, obviously
          after having too much to drink.

               "TinyFugue is the biggest hack since the platform it
          was built on."  -- Explorer_Bob, in one of his lucid
          moments.

          The New York Times, the Christian Science Monitor and the
          Washington Post all refused to comment.

          _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k style name gags and hilites are no longer

          '/hilite hawkeye*'.

          _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k style page and whisper hilites are no longer
          supported.  However, /hilite_page and /hilite_whisper macros
          are provided in the default macro library.

          The .tinytalk file may not be supported in the future; use
          .tfrc instead.

          The '-' command line option in versions prior to 2.0 is no
          longer supported, and has been replaced with '-l'.

          The TINYPREFIX and TINYHELP environment variables are no
          longer used.  Filenames can be defined at runtime with the
          MACROFILE, HILITEFILE, GAGFILE, TRIGFILE, HOOKFILE,
          BINDFILE, WORLDFILE, and HELPFILE macros.

          When unterbamfing, the old connection should not be closed
