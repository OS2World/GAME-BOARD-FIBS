Notation for relases pre-1.4.0 beta is not particularly accurate, and
sometimes changed code was released without updating version numbers.
I don't do this any more.
Only the most recent version will have detailed changes described.

2.1 beta 1 (9/22/92)
--------------------
Added LOGIN hook for user-definable autologin format.
Added logging by world, with "-lig" and "-w[<world>]" options to /log.
Hooks are more like triggers: multiple hooks allowed, arguments must match
  pattern (using priority).  See /help hooks.
The helpfile, ~/.tfrc, and files read by /load may be stored compressed.
Keybindings are now macros.  Added "-b" option to macro commands.  Removed
  builtins /keys, /listbind, /purgebind, /savebind, and /loadbind.
Added BAMF and SHELL hooks.
Rewrote nonblocking connect, the right way (for systems that support it).
  Disabled by default.  See the INSTALLATION file.
Added redirected output for /quote and /repeat with -w option.
"/world <host> <port>" defines a temporary world and connects to it.
Added local command quoting (/quote `).
Argument substitution:  Added %{} syntax; braces act as delmiters, so
  spaces are allowed.  All arg subs can have default values.  (See /help
  expansion).
Added -f<file> command line option.
Added /retry to library.
/repeat and keybinding bodies go through macro expansion.
Replaced /loadworld builtin with standard macro.
Added multi-shot triggers and hooks.
Faster macro lookup.
Improved standard library and helpfile.
Bug fixes: sockmload after /dc or connection closed; /quiet for background
  sockets; watchdog and watchname; transmitting to failed connecttions.
Removed /stty.
Removed need for -DHPUX.

----------

The differences section only applies to things that need to be changed
or are not implemented in TinyFugue.  Tf offers a lot more functionality
in many areas than the clients below, of course.

-------------
Differences from TinyTalk (Tarrant's client)
-------------
Compatibility is almost complete.  All .tinytalk files should work
with Fugue.  The /tinytalk flag (defaults to on) makes the necessary
changes to convert between tinytalk command formats to tinyfugue
command formats.

-------------
Differences from TinyWar (Grod's client)
-------------
Use /sub on to substitute %; and %\ for newlines in regular text
%n works only in macros and triggers, and in /sub full mode
/crypt and /random removed
"%2*" argument sub should be replaced by "%-1"
