This client has a number of features with highly questionable in 
addition to productive uses.  You are just as responsible for any 
damages or inconveniences you cause to a MUD as if you had written 
the client yourself; likewise, I as the author of the client am not 
responsible at all for your actions in its use.  Act accordingly. 
The existence of a feature doesn't necessarily justify its use.
